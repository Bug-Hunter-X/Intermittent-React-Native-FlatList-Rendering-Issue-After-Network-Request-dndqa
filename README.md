# Intermittent React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Native where a `FlatList` component renders incorrectly after a network request.  The issue is characterized by an intermittent blank screen or crash, without any clear error messages in the console. The problem is difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Problem Description

A `FlatList` is used to display data fetched from a remote API.  Under certain conditions (not consistently reproducible), the `FlatList` fails to render correctly after a successful network request, leading to a blank screen or application crash.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and checking the structure of the received JSON data to ensure compatibility with `FlatList`'s rendering logic.  We also add logging to aid in debugging.
